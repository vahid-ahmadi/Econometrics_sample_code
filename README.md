This repository contains sample codes for replicating the econometrics and times series models in the paper "Five Facts about the UIP Premium (Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan & Liliana Varela)". The implementation follows the methodologies described in the paper to ensure accurate reproduction of the results. Due to confidentiality restrictions, most of the modeling and econometrics sections are not included.
